<h1>ATM Interface Project</h1>
<br>
For an <b>ATM Interface Project</b> built using Java, the goal is to simulate an automated teller machine (ATM) that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as <u>withdrawing money</u>, checking balance, depositing money, and viewing transaction history. 

<br><br>
<h2>Project Structure:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Java Classes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>BankAccount: </b> – Represents the user's bank account, including the balance and transaction history.</li>
      <li><b>ATM: </b>– Core logic for performing transactions like deposit, withdraw, and balance check.</li>
      <li><b>Main: </b>– The entry point of the program, which launches the ATM interface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h2>Project Files Overview:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>BankAccount Class: </b>
    <ul>

      <li>Provides the main logic for interacting with the account, including withdrawing     
          funds, depositing money, and viewing the balance.</li>
      <li>Includes security checks like PIN validation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Main Class:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Initializes the program and provides a loop for interacting with the ATM interface.
